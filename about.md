I am Cyril Cathala, a developer with a passion for code, curious and eager more to learn everyday.
I love to work on mobile technologies (Xamarin, Flutter, native iOS/Android...), C#, modern web, geek stuff, etc.

I work at Soat and I am a Microsoft MVP since 2012.
I share and speak about my passion whenever I can, I hope you'll like my blog, thank you for reading me!
